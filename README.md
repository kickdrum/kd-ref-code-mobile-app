# App Setup
Install expo - https://docs.expo.io/
>Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

- `npm install -g expo-cli`
- `expo  --version`
Checkout the expo-cli here - https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/
- Setup the app with `expo init` 
- Give the app name
- Select barebone config as `tabs(typescript)` to intialize a basic mobile app with several example screens and tabs using react-navigation and TypeScript 
- Give --npm if you want to use npm as your package manager(default is yarn)

Run the project using `expo start` for local development
- you can check and test the app on your laptop using `Android(using Android Studio) and iOS(using XCode) emulators`
- or, you can check and test in your physical mobile device by installing an app called `Expo Go` in your device and scanning the QR code generated when you do expo start
